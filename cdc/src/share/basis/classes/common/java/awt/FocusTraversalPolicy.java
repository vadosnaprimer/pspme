/**
 * A FocusTraversalPolicy defines the order in which Components with a
 * particular focus cycle root are traversed. Instances can apply the policy to
 * arbitrary focus cycle roots, allowing themselves to be shared across
 * Containers. They do not need to be reinitialized when the focus cycle roots
 * of a Component hierarchy change.
 * <p>
 * The core responsibility of a FocusTraversalPolicy is to provide algorithms
 * determining the next and previous Components to focus when traversing
 * forward or backward in a UI. Each FocusTraversalPolicy must also provide
 * algorithms for determining the first, last, and default Components in a
 * traversal cycle. First and last Components are used when normal forward and
 * backward traversal, respectively, wraps. The default Component is the first
 * to receive focus when traversing down into a new focus traversal cycle.
 * A FocusTraversalPolicy can optionally provide an algorithm for determining
 * a Window's initial Component. The initial Component is the first to receive
 * focus when a Window is first made visible.
